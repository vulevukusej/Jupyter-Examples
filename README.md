# ifcopenshell-notebooks
Interactive Jupyter Notebooks to teach working with IFC files using ifcopenshell with python.

These Notebooks are part of mandatory classes for Bachelor students of [Architecture at the RWTH Aachen University](https://arch.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/gfa/) and have advanced versions for MSc levels. The notebooks usually run on the [Jupyter Hub of the RWTH Aachen](https://jupyter.rwth-aachen.de) but can be run on other Jupyter Notebook VMs.
They are published ass [Open Educational Resources](https://en.unesco.org/themes/building-knowledge-societies/oer)
